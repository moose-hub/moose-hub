Somehow transitioned from a kid surrounded by arcade machines, video games, and buckets of computer parts (thanks, Dad) to a full-stack developer with a promising future in tech. I spend most of my time trying to build the ideas circling in my brain, utilizing various languages of computer magic.

I also have a habit of relentlessly pursuing new knowledge and sharing my insights on what I've learned.
